Finished introduction to challenge and entered wood league 2.
Received angle and distance as inputs.
current rank 28,660 (i doubt this is relevant since everyone is at least wood league 2 if they solve the first challenge).

This challenge is quite fun and interesting. I am unsure of what i can achieve but I am looking forward to finding out. 

I made a simple solution as indicated by the description and it promoted me to Wood 1.
I don't quite like it at the moment though, it's clunky and it's turning slowly.
I was thinking of improving it a bit by checking before the 90 degrees angle and slowing down before the checkpoint.

Time elapsed : 15 minutes
