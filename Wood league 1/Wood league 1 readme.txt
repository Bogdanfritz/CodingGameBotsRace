Upgraded to wood league 1. obtained boost.
I'm unhappy with my previous solution. I'm thinking of slowing down just before I reach a checkpoint to allow myself to rotate

First i will shorten the rotation window from 90 degrees to 45. Seems to be a faster now.

I am thinking of racing cars. I don't have any knowledge before the race of the track, so the first lap will have to be about "learning" the track (storing each checkpoint and finding a strategy).

There seem to be some racing strategies which i might be able to use.

Second choice i made was to pack my solution into a class for easier future iterations.
